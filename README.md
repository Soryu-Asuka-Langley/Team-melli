Introduction:
The main purpose of our system is to provide an alternative platform for access to music, discuss all things music and interact with other fans, as well as receive personalised music recommendations. The two main problems that were addressed were:
- The lack of social networking on music apps and the lack of platforms made specifically for music discussions.
- The difficulty of discovering a wide array of new music based on music apps recommendation systems.


This web application was built on the Django Framework.
